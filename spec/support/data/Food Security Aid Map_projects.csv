It has also allowed Ultra Rice to be produced at an even more affordable price for later entry into commercial markets that serve the poor. In August 2010, Akshaya Patra, the world's largest school lunch program, began the process of incorporating Ultra Rice into its centralized kitchens in Rajasthan, where rice will be fortified with Ultra Rice through point-of-use ""wet"" blending methods. The iron-fortified rice will soon be served daily to 185,000 schoolchildren - as part of the Mid-Day Meal Programme - for the length of the 2010-2011 school year.","","The Government of India's Department of Biotechnology (DBT), within the Ministry of Science and Technology, continues to generously support promising research into the efficacy and effectiveness of Ultra Rice in multiple locations and demographic groups (in India).

Lack of employment opportunities is a big issue among the members in this community. Most of the men and women remaining are unemployed, the rest are working illegally in the USA because that is their only resource.

Cattle has being purchase to form a cooperative among the members of the community. They organized themselves to work the land where cattle is raised, they make sure it has adequate space, food and provide maintenance on a regular basis. A veterinarian has been hired to train the members of the cooperative on how to maintain and take care of the cattle, how to apply vaccines and other medications to the animals and to monitor their health on a regular basis. Training on milk production, cheese making and basic business practices are also provided to guarantee their insertion into the local markets.

Episcopal Relief & Development,ERD-SB-09-002,Building ACOM Rural Training Centre Sustainability,"The Church of Melanesia operates six Rural Training Centers (RTC), two in Vanuatu and four in the Solomon Islands.  The Church also has three affiliated RTC operated by individual dioceses.  The RTCs were established against the backdrop of many school dropouts from the primary & secondary education systems in Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.  These school dropouts do not have the necessary education or self-esteem to be functioning members in society.  The RTCs provide an avenue for some of the school dropouts to be empowered with useful knowledge, values and skills.  The RTCs do receive some financial assistance from the Governments of Solomon Island and Vanuatu.  Based on the results of a comprehensive review and study of the RTCs conducted in 2009 by Episcopal Relief & Developmentand ACOM, five policy goals have been identified:  1) to increase the number of female students and lower the ratio differential between men and women in all 9 schools; 2) to increase and/or improve the number of business and management courses; 3) To initiate or expand short community courses as a means of increasing impact and nonformal education access; 4) to develop business plans for at least 4 RTCs which result in increasing the income and self sustainability of the individual RTCs; and 5) introducing solar power as both a course and a source of revenue for the school.  The program will be overseen by a Business Development Committee which will function for 2 years. Loans and seed funds for reviewed and accepted  business plans will be made available as part of the 2011 program.  The program will measure impact of business development plans and solar energy course on the self sustainability of the RTCs.","","",2009-03-15,2011-12-30,"","","Economic Recovery and Development,Education",Capacity building,Church of the Province of Melanesia,"",Private donations,"",746,"","Individuals, Staff, Women, Youth","Solomon Islands,Vanuatu","Central,Guadalcanal,Isabel,Makira,Malaita,Western","","","","",Nagulan Nesiah,Program Officer,nnesiah@er-d.org,"",www.er-d.org,2010-10-13,"",""

A demonstration garden will be set up in each identified parish and the beneficiaries will be taught together by a permaculture expert how to apply these methods.  The women will receive farm inputs and, applying the knowledge learned during trainings, will then create kitchen gardens in their own homes so they can begin to provide a variety of food and additional income for their families. The beneficiaries will also learn to care for fruit trees and animals so families can start small animal husbandry businesses. The Mothers' Union department will focus the One-Village-at-a-Time program on vulnerable women,who generally care for many AIDS orphans. The aim is to  to help feed the families in the community and to empower women by providing start up funds to undertake Permaculture Agriculture and animal husbandry businesses.

Women for Women International,WWI-AF-08-CIFI03AP,Commercial Integrated Farming Initiative (CIFI) - Afghanistan,"CIFI is Women for Women International's flagship income generation program that focuses on training up to 1,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugee, returnee, and other socially excluded women per year  in organic commercial integrated agriculture for sustained income generation and food security.  Participants are able to select commercial integrated farming as their vocational track after receiving 3 months of core program training and understand their income generation opportunities. During their training, participants learn to integrate crop and animal husbandry and how to strategically choose marketable products to produce. Products that are selected are targeted for both local and niche/broader markets.  Highly marketable traditional crops are produced to meet local demand and less typical, preferably higher value crops, are produced that have a niche market and offer the potential to reach broader markets. The goal after three to five years is to establish a core of functioning cooperatives capable of producing and marketing high quality, high value agriculutral products.  The long-term vision of CIFI is a women-led agricultural value chain whereby women are participants in every facet of the production cycle: producers, processors, distributors, managers and owners.   ",CIFI activities include: training (theory and practical) in organic commercial integrated farming; cooperative development and governance; identifying sustainable markets; linking CIFI participants to market partnerships; establishment of follow-up services including agricultural extension and business development.  ,"Based on the results in Sudan and Rwanda, CIFI-Afghanistan is currently a pilot program with a primary emphasis on poultry production. Poultry production focuses on layers and broilers to supply the local market with fresh eggs and a significant protein source. The poultry production facility in Parwan Province will serve as the model for the Poultry Marketing Initiative in Nigeria. In addition to poultry, CIFI-Afghanistan has cultivated cucumbers, started an apiary, and are raising goats for dairy production. Initial market assessments have provided evidence of a strong demand for locally grown and produced products.  As the project progresses, CIFI-Afghanistan will work closely with the microfinance office of Women for Women International to provide graduate farmers with financial assistance in supporting their agricultural income generation activities.

Oxfam America,OXFA-ML-10-MAL 020 ?10,Capacity Building of Cotton Program Beneficiaries to Adapt to Climate Change,"In Mali climate change (CC) will lead to an increase of temperature associated with possible lowering of rainfall, but also extreme climatic events. The consequences are a decrease of agricultural production, mainly in the yield of cereals and cash crops such as cotton. The Malian National Action Plan of Adaptation to CC highlights the high vulnerability of rural small farmers, who are the main beneficiaries of the program. Therefore it is necessary to evaluate and implement possible adaptation options for program beneficiaries, particularly women. Linked to this wider program, the processes of action-research are intended to support small scale rural farmers to reduce their vulnerability and to better adapt to the climate variability including extreme events and climate change. Beyond the need to understand the precise nature of this vulnerability and to make an assessment of the possible adaptation options, another challenge is ensuring that a larger number of farmers master these strategies and adaptation options and implement them in communities. Assessment will lead to better information, education and communication campaign on climate change and its adverse effects. Pilot projects will also be implemented to test the best sustainable practices for adaptation, such as the early warning systems, innovative risk-reducing community funds, and the use of the available research results.

Women for Women International,WWI-SD-08-CIFI01S,Commercial Integrated Farming Initiative (CIFI) - Sudan,"CIFI is Women for Women International's flagship income generation program that focuses on training up to 1,000 socially excluded women per year in organic commercial integrated agriculture for sustained income generation and food security.  Participants are able to select commercial integrated farming as their vocational track after receiving 3 months of core program training and understand their income generation opportunities. During their training, participants learn to integrate crop and animal husbandry and how to strategically choose marketable products to produce. Products that are selected are targeted for both local and niche/broader markets.  Highly marketable traditional crops are produced to meet local demand and less typical, preferably higher value crops, are produced that have a niche market and offer the potential to reach broader markets. The goal after three to five years is to establish a core of functioning cooperatives capable of producing and marketing high quality, high value agriculutral products.  The long-term vision of CIFI is a women-led agricultural value chain whereby women are participants in every facet of the production cycle: producers, processors, distributors, managers and owners.   ",CIFI activities include: training (theory and practical) in organic commercial integrated farming; cooperative development and governance; identifying sustainable markets; linking CIFI participants to market partnerships; establishment of follow-up services including agricultural extension and business development.  ,"CIFI-Sudan produces a wide variety of vegetables including cow peas, maize, okra, onions, kales,spider plant, jewsmallow (kudhura), cucumber, green pepper, eggplants, squash, amaranthus and food crops including  maize, sorghum and ground nuts. In addition, the farm raises poultry (layers; future expansion will include the piloting of broilers) and bees for honey production. Oxen are also used as traction animals. Ninety hectares of a community donated land has allowed CIFI-Sudan to be one of only two commercial fresh egg and vegetable producing farms in Lakes State. The high demand for local, fresh eggs and vegetables will prove to be a substantial income generation potential for participants. Since the projects inception, an average of 96% of participants have reported an increase in their income. Recently, participants reported earning US$35-US$42 a day from selling vegetables.

The project targets the sub project holder GIE Jubo Ligguey in the village of Baback Ndiongore situated in the district of Bambey.
Initially the project will provide 53 reproductive age sheep (48 ewes and 5 rams.) to 24 families. Each family receives initial placements of 2 ewes. The project will also initially provide 10 kilos of research quality seeds to an additional 32 families. In all 56 families will receive original placements while 224 families will receive POG for a total of 280 families who will benefit through this project.
By the 5th year, through the innovative POG design, the project will pass on successively 2 animals of the same species to reach a total of 120 assisted families and 10 kilos of nationally certified seeds to 160 families, involving a total of 1,960 dependents.

These savings and cooperative groups have a combined total membership of over 1,500 individuals, of which 40% are women, which represent more than 17 different local villages.  This project is unique in that the implementation area spans both ward and district lines to encourage a watershed-based approach to natural resource management. Partnering with the communities within the watershed promotes collaboration which will contribute to community ownership of the project and sustainability.  LWR and its network of partners will support Mlali, Matomondo and Lumuma SACCOS to increase organizational capacity, promote sustainable natural resource management, and increase and diversify revenue sources to improve the communities' resilience to natural disasters, increase food security and improve livelihoods across the region.  Objective #1:  Increase productive use of labor, land and water to strengthen resilience to climate shocks and improve food security and rural livelihoods for more than 40,000 smallholder farmers. Objective #2:  Use draught animals to improve fertility and productivity of soil to increase crop yields of maize and sunflower to at least three times current production levels.  Objective #3: Diversify and increase producer revenue by four-fold through animal husbandry and dairy production, processing and marketing. Objective #4:  Strengthen organizational and technical capacity of SACCOS members to increase opportunities for economies of scale, and improved terms of trade among small-scale farmers.

It has also allowed Ultra Rice to be produced at an even more affordable price for later entry into commercial markets that serve the poor.

Building on experience gained from working in water and sanitation in the rural areas of the country, Episcopal Relief & Development sought to implement a similar program of community participation and education--however, this time focused on agriculture. Partnering with a Nicaraguan ecumenical organization, the Council of Protestant Churches of Nicaragua, Episcopal Relief & Development is training women and men small-farmers in 14 rural communities in improved agriculture techniques. The program will train volunteer agriculture promoters, who are members of the communities, who in turn will each train other promoters for a total of 168 trained individuals. Through the trained volunteers, the program will primarily disseminate improved agriculture techniques by each promoter establishing a demonstration plot by which community members are shown and learn improved techniques by doing them in their own plots. At least 1/3 of trainees must be women. In addition, a special emphasis will be on environmental preservation through the teaching of soil conservation techniques. Our goals will be to increase the caloric intake of members of 14 communities and reduce by half the proportion of children under 5 who are underweight.

A demonstration garden will be set up in each identified parish and the beneficiaries will be taught together by a permaculture expert how to apply these methods.  The women will receive farm inputs and, applying the knowledge learned during trainings, will then create kitchen gardens in their own homes so they can begin to provide a variety of food and additional income for their families. The beneficiaries will also learn to care for fruit trees and animals so families can start small animal husbandry businesses. The Mothers' Union department will focus the One-Village-at-a-Time program on vulnerable women,who generally care for many AIDS orphans. The aim is to  to help feed the families in the community and to empower women by providing start up funds to undertake Permaculture Agriculture and animal husbandry businesses. This undertaking increases the abundance and quality of the food in the village, feeds the orphans, and creates micro-agriculture and animal husbandry businesses which increase the economic strength of the village.","","",2009-01-01,2012-12-31,"","","Agriculture,Economic Recovery and Development",Capacity building,Diocese of Southern Malawi,"",Private donations,"",150,"",Women,Malawi,Southern,"","","","",Danielle Tirello,Program Officer,dtirello@er-d.org,"",www.er-d.org,2010-10-13,"",""

Haiti faces a significant structural food deficit, and malnutrition is widespread. This agriculture and environmental program focuses on improving the food production of peasant populations through a diversified reforestation, gardening, and agro-forestry program.  In this way, the program addresses both the short-term food needs of the people and the long-term environmental needs to prevent soil erosion in mountainous areas.  Working with the farmers’ association, CODEP, in the Léogâne and Grand-Goâve communes, this program’s objectives are: 1) To promote soil stabilization through the establishment of 140 miles of hedgerow terraces on mountainsides; 2) To combat deforestation through training and planting of up to 1,000,000 trees; and 3) To improve household food diversity through the establishment of household vegetable gardens.","","",2006-07-01,2011-12-31,"",Food Security and Agriculture,"Agriculture,Environment",Livelihoods,Comprehensive Development Project (CODEP),Haiti Fund Inc.,Private donations,"",3000,"",Farmers,Haiti,Ouest,Léogâne,Léogâne,"","",Matthew St. John,Program Officer,mstjohn@er-d.org,"","",2010-05-17,2010-12-10,""

Episcopal Relief & Development,ERD-CO-09-001,Diocesan Coordination for Development Projects,"Colombia has approximately 3 million internally displaced people, the second largest internal refugee problem in the world after Darfur, caused by violence from the civil war.  Some sources have indicated that in the Choco region, for example, there is one doctor per 10,000 people, but one soldier per 180 people.  Also, the unemployment rate is 85% and the average person makes only US$250 per year; or less than US$1 per day. Colombian society is one of the most unequal in terms of economic wealth in the world.  As a result, there is wide social and economic exclusion and huge rich to poor disparities. In the city of Cali, chronic poverty caused by social and economic exclusion and violence, has caused child malnutrition, high incidences of HIV-AIDS, family disintegration, intra-familial violence, and lack of income earning opportunities especially for women. In Quibdo, the capital of Choco, unemployed youth and street children are affected by crushing poverty, violence, and lack of economic opportunities. Great social inequality and marginalized populations of youth are easy victims of violence, prostitution, and being forced into serving with illegal armed groups. As a result and building on the church's current capacity, Episcopal Relief & Development has implemented a pilot project in partnership with the the Diocese in Colombia, to implement a microcredit project in Cali targeting women, and a youth education and training project in Quibdo, Choco.  In addition, the partnership will strengthen the church's capacity to guide and expand this program to other regions for increased impact.","","",2009-10-01,2012-12-31,"","","Economic Recovery and Development,Education","",Diocese of Colombia,"",Private donations,"",100,"","Women, Youth",Colombia,"Chocó,Valle del Cauca","","","","",Matt St. John,Program Officer,mstjohn@er-d.org,"",www.er-d.org,2010-10-13,"",""

To support these core interventions, Winrock will assist Katalyst in the design and implementation of supporting interventions. These may include promotion of improved post-harvest handling, food safety practices, and quality control measures that will lead to better market penetration. A focus on poverty, gender, and environmental and social responsibility of business (ESRB) will be mainstreamed across all Winrock prawn interventions.
","The specific activities of the expanded prawn program are:
- Design and implement market development interventions for the prawn market building on the learning and experiences of Katalyst.
- Incorporate pro-poor strategies in designing interventions so that the impacts can benefit the people living below the poverty line and whose livelihood depends directly or indirectly on prawn market.
- Incorporate gender strategies in designing interventions so that women can be more empowered by being economic agents in different stages of the prawn value chain.
- Tackle environmental concerns, wherever applicable, so that the interventions address the issues related to environmental degradation.
- Create public-private partnership in promoting sustainable development to ensure that the impacts are distributed across that value chain leading to equitable development and improved livelihood for the poor.

The main activities under this project will include; mapping the stakeholders providing support to OVCs and linking children to those services (through referrals); training in life skills (sexual and reproductive health, interpersonal relationships); training parents/guardians and child mentors in child counselling.  Other activities will include provision of educational materials, support formation of school child protection clubs as well as training in business entrepreneurship skills as well as provision of capital to start Income Generating Activities.  Awareness campaigns on the needs of OVCs including their rights will be conducted with families and the broader community members including the traditional leadership. This project therefore will endeavour to provide a comprehensive OVC package and increase impact on their livelihoods. Care and support to OVC will be integrated with prevention aspects.

Participants are able to select commercial integrated farming as their vocational track after receiving 3 months of core program training and understand their income generation opportunities. During their training, participants learn to integrate crop and animal husbandry and how to strategically choose marketable products to produce. Products that are selected are targeted for both local and niche/broader markets.  Highly marketable traditional crops are produced to meet local demand and less typical, preferably higher value crops, are produced that have a niche market and offer the potential to reach broader markets. The goal after three to five years is to establish a core of functioning cooperatives capable of producing and marketing high quality, high value agricultural products.  The long-term vision of CIFI is a women-led agricultural value chain whereby women are participants in every facet of the production cycle: producers, processors, distributors, managers and owners.   ",CIFI activities include: training (theory and practical) in organic commercial integrated farming; cooperative development and governance; identifying sustainable markets; linking CIFI participants to market partnerships; establishment of follow-up services including agricultural extension and business development.  ,"Crops on CIFI-Rwanda's 40 hectares of donated land include chili peppers, pineapples, maize and beans.  The entire inaugural bean harvest (11,000+kg) in 2010 was purchased by the World Food Program's Purchase for Progress (P4P) Project. In addition, P4P has also agreed to purchase the whole  maize harvest projected at 5000+Kg. A unique aspect of CIFI-Rwanda is its proximity to the forthcoming Women's Opportunity Center (WOC). The WOC-Rwanda will serve as a permanent establishment for women to gather, providing an interactive environment where they can cultivate their collective bargaining power and facilitate women-led community change.

Hundreds of thousands of people were forced from their homes, and many became refugees in Guinea and Liberia. A lasting feature of the war were the atrocities committed by the rebels, whose trademark was to hack off the hands or feet of their victims and kidnap children to use as ""child soldiers"". As Sierra Leone works to heal after years of war, the Diocese of Bo is focusing on fostering resettlement by improving the food supply in 12 communities. The causes of chronic hunger and malnutrition are diverse in these communities and the diocese is focused on securing them a means of income and food supply. The creation of a Moringa nursery functions as both a source of food and of traditional medicine. Moringa, a drought resistant tropical tree, is a source of  quick growing leaves which have been shown to improve the weight and production of livestock as well as being suitable to prevent malnutrition and vitamin deficiency in people. The diocese is training and providing these inputs in order to increase the technical skills of these communities. The residual effects of the war and challenges of poverty have increased the vulnerability of individuals. The problem of gender inequality and violence has created unimaginable consequences and the diocese is focusing on working with communities in order to promote gender awareness and equality by holding education workshops on gender based violence at the diocesan and community levels.","","",2009-01-01,2012-12-31,"","","Agriculture,Protection","Capacity building, Gender",Diocese of Bo ,"",Private donations,"",3000,"","Religious leaders/Clergy, Staff, Children, Children under 5, Men, Women",Sierra Leone,Southern,"","","","",Danielle Tirello,Program Officer,dtirello@er-d.org,"",www.er-d.org,2010-10-13,"",""

This approach has allowed PATH to test the feasibility, acceptance and effectiveness of Ultra Rice kernels, establish distribution to nutritionally vulnerable groups with little incremental cost, and cultivate demand from institutional buyers to drive economies of scale. It has also allowed Ultra Rice to be produced at an even more affordable price for later entry into commercial markets that serve the poor. The Burundi Demonstration Project represents Ultra Rice's first foray into Africa. Project activities will include both operational and biological impact assessments.

Concern Worldwide,CONW-ZW-11-001,Realigning Agriculture to Improve Nutrition (RAIN),"This project, realigning agriculture to improve nutrition (RAIN), aims to reduce the prevalence of stunting in children through interventions during the critical period from conception until 24 months of age, roughly equivalent to the first 1000 days of life, as chronic malnutrition is largely irreversible after the age of two years. In doing so, it will generate evidence of the best approach to do this and document the impact pathways that are most optimal. Interventions have been selected in agriculture, nutrition, health and gender equality that have a strong evidence base or, where there is no evidence base, where expert opinion endorses their use. The project will utilize the existing evidence base and improve it the where gaps exist through an appropriate project design and ongoing operations research. Empowerment of women will be a cornerstone of the approach and a key outcome of the envisioned system change, as it is well recognized that women, as food producers and primary caretakers, play a key role in influencing the nutritional outcomes in their children.

Lutheran World Relief,LWR-KE-09-AF-KEN-3-001-10,Back From the Brink: Rapid Response to Hunger and Lack of Resiliency in Eastern Kenya,"LWR will work with two partners—Neema Self Help Group and Makindu River Irrigation Farms Self Help Group. Both groups were established in 2006 with an aim of harnessing water from Makindu River for domestic and agricultural use. LWR will accompany Neema and Makindu as they bring vulnerable populations back from the brink of starvation by providing immediate access to food and water and avoid further expansion of the crisis by increasing resiliency and effective agricultural production in drought affected areas of Eastern Kenya. Concretely, this project will increase food and water accessibility immediately for 7,500 people and their 37,500 household members through a cash-for-work program that will rehabilitate local irrigation systems. In addition, this project will avert further crisis by increasing food production in the upcoming growing seasons through improved irrigation, soil and water conservation systems and practices, stronger local management and technical skills, and access to financial services for more than 1,000 farmers in Makindu division. Objectives: (1) Objective #1:  Immediately increase food and water accessibility for 7,500 community members on the rehabilitation of Neema and Makindu river irrigation networks. (2) Increase resiliency for climate and price shocks by boosting sustainable local production and farmer income through the acquisition of needed management and technical skills and access to financial services for more than 1,000 farmers in Makindu district. (3) Strengthen the capacity of NEEMA and Makindu SHGs to implement effective crisis response and agricultural resiliency programming.

Episcopal Relief & Development,ERD-ZM-08-001,Zambian Anglican Council-Core Program,"While only 14% of Zambia's land is now under cultivation, the majority of its people support themselves through agriculture. Increased food production is possible as Zambia possesses plenty of land and water resources for agriculture and rural development.  ZAC is working to increase the agriculture productivity in order to ensure food security, income generation, and a reduction of poverty at the household level. The project is assisting communities to access farm inputs, and promoting the use of ox drawn ploughs. A practice of using local materials for poultry feed production, initiated at one of the sites last year, is being replicated at four other project sites. The number of clean water sources and sanitary facilities is being increased and irrigation projects from river sources are being developed to use the river water for the irrigation of vegetables. Water resource use will continue in a sustainable fashion while maintaining an equitable provision of adequate quantity and quality of water.  The access to formal government schools is limited and as a result many children and adults have missed the opportunity for basic education. The project works to enroll orphans and vulnerable children in community schools, and trains volunteer community adult literacy instructors and open adult learning classes. ZAC is strengthening the ability of the women and youth in the project sites to make positive changes in their lives by increasing their knowledge and skills, in order to protect them against mistreatment through economic empowerment. This includes education on HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis as well as training for mothers in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

Caribbean Harvest’s staff teaches the family how to raise the fish and then provides ongoing weekly oversight. In just four months, fish are fully grown and can be sold in markets. Profits earned from the sale of the fish give each family approximately $500 in addition to covering the cost of purchasing another 2,400 baby fish and four-month supply of fish food. The harvest cycle repeats almost 2.5 times a year, helping each family earn an annual income of around $1,200.

Objectives - (1) Improved sesame production and marketing lead to increased incomes: Access to capital, training and acquisition of necessary technology results in a 68 fold increase in production and an 18 fold increase in net incomes by project end. Organic certification increases market outlets and fetches better prices for the Federation's sesame. (2) Strengthened organizational capacities: Federation members are trained in technical and financial matters, literacy, equipment and stock management, and associative life to ensure sustainability of the project's activities. The group develops a business plan to guide future operations.

Episcopal Relief & Development,ERD-MZ-09-001,Lebombo Development Program  ,"Episcopal Relief & Development is supporting the Diocese of Lebombo (one of two Anglican dioceses in Mozambique and part of the Church of the Province of Southern Africa) to implement a Food Security Program in the Province of Xai-Xai, Bilene District; specifically, in Tlacula, and Macia Village, both located in the archdeaconry of Limpopo. Agricultural production is the main source of food for more than 85% of households in these areas and a key source of household income. However, these areas located in the southern part of the country frequently suffer from drought.  In particular southern Gaza Province has experienced reduced rainfall of 40-60%.  As a result, crops have been planted late. Building on the community networks and delivery systems established through Episcopal Relief & Development's Malaria prevention Nets for Life program with the Diocese of Lebombo, this program intends to enhance food security and nutritional diet by: 1) Improving the agricultural production techniques that are already being used in the target  communities; 2) Providing tools for the diversification of crops according to agro-climatic conditions of the areas covered by the program, as well as the need of the most vulnerable groups, such as People Living with HIV&AIDS; and 3) Increasing people's access and use of food for income generation. Specific outcomes include: 1) Increased production of food at the household level and to facilitate their marketing; 2) Increased level of community organization as well as creation of agriculture associations; 3) Increased participation and decision-making of women; and 4) Reduction of the negative effects of the environment on agricultural activities.","","",2009-01-01,2012-12-31,"","",Agriculture,Capacity building,Diocese of Lebombo,"",Private donations,"",700,"","",Mozambique,Gaza,"","","","",Janette O'Neill,Program Officer,joneill@er-d.org,"",www.er-d.org,2010-10-13,"",""

Women for Women International,WWI-CD-10-CIFI04D,Commercial Integrated Farming Initiative (CIFI) - DRC,"CIFI is Women for Women International's flagship income generation program that focuses on training up to 1,000 socially excluded women per year in organic commercial integrated agriculture for sustained income generation and food security. Participants are able to select commercial integrated farming as their vocational track after receiving 3 months of core program training and understand their income generation opportunities. During their training, participants learn to integrate crop and animal husbandry and how to strategically choose marketable products to produce. Products that are selected are targeted for both local and niche/broader markets.  Highly marketable traditional crops are produced to meet local demand and less typical, preferably higher value crops, are produced that have a niche market and offer the potential to reach broader markets. The goal after three to five years is to establish a core of functioning cooperatives capable of producing and marketing high quality, high value agriculutral products.  The long-term vision of CIFI is a women-led agricultural value chain whereby women are participants in every facet of the production cycle: producers, processors, distributors, managers and owners.   ",CIFI activities include: training (theory and practical) in organic commercial integrated farming; cooperative development and governance; identifying sustainable markets; linking CIFI participants to market partnerships; establishment of follow-up services including agricultural extension agents and business development.  ,"CIFI-DRC was the next logical location for implementation of Women for Women International's commercial farming initiative. The fertile land in Walungu Territory, South Kivu will provide the foundation for launching CIFI-DRC. In agreement with local authorities, CIFI-DRC was able to acquire 90 hectares of farmland for the cultivation of crops like: onions, eggplants, cabbage, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, maize, beans and sorghum.  In addition, the animal husbandry component of CIFI-DRC will include guinea pigs, rabbits and  goats. A market study will be performed to assess other  higher-value products that could be grown (in concert with a soil analysis to determine the agro-ecological suitability of selected crops) and potential bulk buyers.

Catholic Relief Services (CRS),CRS-HT-10-7420114,Multi-Year Assistance Program,"The MYAP builds on the success of previous CRS Haiti DAPs by tightening the geographic targeting to highly food insecure, environmentally fragile watersheds.  Rather than dispersing sector activities across wide geographic areas, this MYAP will take a holistic and focused approach to manage risks and reduce vulnerability to food insecurity.

Agriculture and natural resource management in these watersheds will include a FFW component.  In addition to the recuperative feeding program, the MCHN feeding program will now provide supplemental family rations for all children 6-24 months.  These rations will be delivered directly to the Rally Posts.  This change increases coverage to all at risk children before their growth falters.  It also saves the mother's time and effort by bringing food closer to the target villages.  

The Haiti MYAP education component builds on CRS' experience in food-assisted education activities in the proposed MYAP-targeted watershed.  The past DAP education component was successfully evaluated and demonstrated a high level of achievement against both impact and monitoring indicators.  The strengths and lessons learned inform this MYAP.

In the context of the FFP Strategic Framework, the MYAP will reach 144,060 direct and 143,800 indirect beneficiaries in the South, South East, Nippes, and Grande Anse Departments.  Natural Resource Management (NRM) activities will protect and enhance farmers' livelihoods.  Improved farming and conservation technique will influence key factors affecting food security.  Improved access to and quality of education and health services will protect and enhance the human capabilities of primary school students, pregnant and lactating women, and vulnerable infants and children. Early warning and emergency surge capacity will improve community resiliency in accordance with Development Relief (DR) principles.

Education in human and economic rights is essential to ending the cycle of ignorance and discrimination that limit women's lives. The program's empowerment goals also focus specifically on women who have been traumatized by rape and other sexual violence.  Rape victims are provided with access to medical care.

Lutheran World Relief,LWR-KE-09-AF-KEN-3-003-09,Strengthening Food Security among Communities Affected by HIV/AIDS,"LWR’s partner for this project is Baba Foundation, an organization created to address issues of HIV/AIDS within the community. The foundation has been working in the community since 2002 to assist people living with HIV/AIDS, widows, guardians/caretakers of orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs) and sexually abused children, and children working in the fishing industry. Baba Foundation will collaborate with District and Ministry of Education authorities, community leaders, and volunteer advocates to promote child protection and school retention strategies. The project will involve work with the Kenya Agriculture Research Institute and the Ministry of Agriculture in food security activities for households supporting OVCs. Participants will make a farm study visit to REEP, a current LWR partner. The project will also leverage credit for seed production and flour processing with loans provided through K-REP Development Agency, another LWR partner. Objective: (1) Increased support for HIV/AIDS-affected children: A greater number of OVCs access education and psycho-social support from the current 36 to 600 through children's rights campaigns targeting 20 school, 2,500 community members and 50 key stakeholders; (2) Increased Food Security: 200 households supporting OVCs will achieve food security through enhanced access to inputs and technical assistance in the production of 400 tons of cassava, 200 tons of sweet potatoes, and 36 tons of sorghum per season. (3) Increased Capacity: By 2013, Baba Foundation and its members will have the capacity to manage community programs that generate enough income to cover 10% of their operations and 50% of their community support system needs by processing and marketing cassava, sweet potato, and sorghum flours.

During the 1980's and 1990's, this area was affected by local terrorism movements. A lot of people died during that era, most of them men head of households, leaving women with no economic support. This project creates opportunities for micro entrepreneurs, mostly women,  that cannot get access to loans in the regular financial system. In addition to the loans, this program provides training and capacity building for the entrepreneurs in order to facilitate access to the mainstream economic life. The program forms community credit circles run by the group members. The members first receive workshops on leadership, self-esteem, and conflict resolution. ECLOF Peru then provides the group an initial group loan which is then sub-loaned out to each group member for income generating activities. The principal is paid back with market interest rates to the group which in turn pays the loan to ECLOF.  All group members must cover the liabilities of members who fail to pay their loans creating a community imperative for each member to comply with repayment. Successful groups pay their loans on time and are then eligible for a subsequent loan for a higher amount. Group members receive encouragement and  business counseling as they use the credit to build their businesses.

Concern Worldwide,CONW-ZM-10-001,Effecting Improvements in Livelihoods through Conservation Agriculture,"Conservation Agriculture is a radically different way of crop production that avoids disturbing the soil by traditional ploughing and hand tillage. This reduces the amount of energy needed to plant crops, conserves soil moisture, reduces erosion and enables farmers to plant as soon as the rains start - guaranteeing higher yields and earlier harvests. By reducing the amount of energy required to prepare fields for planting Concern seeks to reduce women's workloads during the planting period.  Concern Worldwide has been promoting CA in Zimbabwe since 2004. In the difficult political and economic situation in Zimbabwe in 2008 there was widespread need for food aid; however the poor farmers trained by Concern in CA would have needed 50% less food aid than the control group (farmers of similar wealth using traditional farming techniques). In 2009 the CA-trained farmers were producing a surplus and so, instead of distributing food aid, Concern distributed cash to the most vulnerable poor in rural areas to enable them to buy food from the CA trained farmers. Concern Worldwide will scale-up the work in Zimbabwe by introducing CA to Malawi and Zambia, which have similar agro-ecological conditions. Concern will use the extension methodologies developed in Zimbabwe as these have proved to be highly effective. This will involve training government and NGO technical staff in the agronomy of CA so that they can provide extension services to farmers. The project will select innovative farmers willing to test CA. These farmers will be trained as Master Farmers and, when they have mastered CA, will then be responsible for training clusters of poor, mainly women, farmers. Each farmer will create a 0.25 ha CA plot, which will be used to grow maize, sorghum and a legume crop (cowpeas, groundnuts, kidney beans, and soya). Those farmers with access to draught animals (oxen, donkeys) will be taught how to use a ripper, those without will be taught to use planting basins (Zaï holes).

The Burundi civil war was an armed conflict lasting from 1993 to 2005 which was the result of long standing ethnic divisions between the Hutu and the Tutsi tribes in Burundi.  The integrated development program is targeting poor rural dwellers located in all 6 dioceses of the Anglican church; the Dioceses of Matana, Makamba, Bujumbura, Gitega, Buye and Muyinga. The goal of this program is aimed at strengthening livelihoods and rehabilitating 6000 of the poorest households by creating economic opportunities through microfinance loans, specifically, but not exclusively,  to those suffering from  HIV and AIDS. The Province is also working to strengthen the food supply and increase animal production in all of the dioceses which includes establishing a networking group in order to diversify the sources of income for farmers. This is of particular importance in the north of the country, where agricultural and nutrition training must take into account the potential for disaster due to drought.  In the water and sanitation program the Province is working to provide clean water to poor communities by setting up rainwater harvest projects in schools, parishes and in rural communities.  Community programs are also addressing the needs of the returning refugees, which include peace building, nonviolent conflict reconciliation, and trauma counseling. Alongside the development programming, Episcopal Relief & Development is working to strengthen and reinforce the technical capacity of the Provincial and Diocesan development staff.

Additionally, 72 percent of the population lives in extreme poverty, which contributes to deforestation of private and community forests as crops are planted. This generates pressure on the soil and leads to an undesirable mix of crops and coniferous and mixed forests. Heifer will help the community develop strategies to preserve and use their forests resources productively through reforestation and good use of existing forested areas. Heifer will also provide 300 families120 original families and 180 by passing on the gift30 sheep, four bovine studs, 30 milking goats, four goat studs, 30 trios of rabbits, 30 flocks of chickens, 1,440 fruit trees, tree nursery bags, and 124 training sessions.

The projects' primary goal is to contribute to the improvement of nutrition, food security and household incomes through the processing and marketing of fonio products. It is also expected that the processing of fonio will stimulate the production of more quantities of this crop, thus contributing to increased food security in the area. The objectives of the project will be achieved through access to agricultural inputs, processing equipment and technical assistance and increased capacity to produce, process and market quality fonio in local and export markets. Objectives - (1) Increased Production in terms of Quality and Quantity: In two years, the association will have acquired high quality seeds and modern processing equipment which will allow them to increase production of quality fonio by 50%.

Episcopal Relief & Development,ERD-CN-09-001,Qinghai Renewable Energy Integrated Program,"The 2009-2011 program is in Qinghai Province, in the far western part of China, serving Tibetan herding communities. The communities are in the source area for three of China's major rivers in a national nature preserve. The herders reside at high altitudes in the mountains, enduring the harsh climate with little access to basic services. The Tibetans raise yak herds for meat and butter. Women collect yak dung to heat their homes. Inside small, dark homes, yak butter is used as candle wax to dimly light the rooms at night, which is difficult on eyesight and on children who study. Residential schools do not have light in the evening for children to study by or hot water systems to maintain basic hygiene. There is little access to basic health knowledge and nutrition is poor, as the climate makes raising vegetables difficult. The program will provide solar power systems for herding families to provide clean energy to people in previously inaccessible areas.  This will allow for more productive activities, including study and livelihood activities, at night.  Local clinics will also be provided with light systems, enabling nighttime and emergency treatment for community members. Light and hot water systems will be provided to three residential schools so children can stay in their warm classroom in the evenings to learn and play. Provision of hot water will promote hygiene and child health. Ten household biogas systems will also be provided in conjunction with greenhouses to promote the growth of vegetables to improve community nutrition. The project also includes training in maternal and child health and hygiene, livelihood skills,and solar power maintenance.

Countless others have been persecuted, pillaged and tortured. The armed conflict in the DRC is acknowledged as the deadliest war in Africa ever recorded and is regarded as one of the cruelest conflict zones for women and girls in recent history. Throughout the conflict, tens of thousands of women and girls have been raped, sexually assaulted, attacked and abducted. The Diocese of Boga is implementing a women's microfinance program serving the vulnerable mothers and children that have been either victimized or affected by the recent conflict. This population also faces discrimination and exclusion from income generating practices and are often left dependent on their husbands or family in order to survive.  The program aims to empower this population by improving their food supply, taking into account the effects the war. Included in this program, the diocese is helping rape victims acquire HIV and AIDS tests and awareness on HIV and AIDS treatment and prevention.  Alongside the rehabilitation of the population, the peace and reconciliation program aims to train clergy on methods of the peace process that will be included in their weekly sermons.
